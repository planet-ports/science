;;; This code has utility functions that can be used to assure floats for unsafe
;;; code. The basic philosophy we are taking is to use the unsafe operations
;;; where it makes sense, but to protect the code so that the operands to unsafe
;;; operations are guaranteed to be of the correct type.
;;;
;;; Version  Date      Description
;;; 4.0.0    05/16/10  Moved the unsafe ops utility functions from math.ss and
;;;                    added with-fixed. (MDW)
